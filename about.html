        <p>
            Hello! I'm Alen John. I'm passionate about cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I specialize in monitoring security incidents, detecting threats, and conducting penetration tests. I also love contributing to open-source projects and learning new techniques to improve my skills in various areas of cybersecurity.

            I have hands-on experience with various tools such as Wireshark, Metasploit, and Nmap, and have participated in several security assessments and vulnerability analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m constantly learning and evolving to stay ahead in the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. My aim is to help organizations stay secure by identifying weaknesses and providing solutions to mitigate risks.
